# WaterDropJS
animated water drop 

## Overview
So this is a project that I tend to recreate often with new languages I use. It tends to be my Hello World. I dont know a lot about coding and I wont pretend to be a master, but I remember sitting there reading books or watching lectures or practicing coding and getting the basics and I just remember thinking when in the world will I get to make graphics!!! well unfortunately it took me a while but I finally learned swing for a jave class in college and I got to make some pretty cool stuff. after the class I made this cool water drop animation. check it out in all of its early day glory below. this was in java. I then rebuilt it is Processing which is bassically java but just better to quickly make graphics. If you have not checke dit out and you like graphics.... go check that shit out now!!!! https://processing.org/ ...you are welcome.
