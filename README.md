# WaterDropJS
animated water drop

## Overview
So this is a project that I tend to recreate often with new languages I use. It tends to be my Hello World. I dont know a lot about coding and I wont pretend to be a master, but I remember sitting there reading books or watching lectures or practicing coding and getting the basics and I just remember thinking when in the world will I get to make graphics!!! well unfortunately it took me a while but I finally learned swing for a java class in college and I got to make some pretty cool stuff. after the class I made this cool water drop animation. check it out in all of its early day glory below. this was in java. I then rebuilt it is Processing which is basically java but just better to quickly make graphics. If you have not checked it out and you like graphics.... go check that shit out now!!!! https://processing.org/ ...you are welcome.

So...yeah it was completely amazing to me at the time... now that I look at it? well
it could be better. So as I was saying above. I converted this to processing.
from there I easily ported it to javascript using the processing library. this is what is contained
in this project.
